#  Seattle Sounders continue dominant play at home with win against rival Portland Timbers 

The Seattle Sounders continued their dominant play at home with a 3-1 victory over the rival Portland Timbers. The Sounders have now won six of their last seven home games, outscoring opponents 19-5 in that stretch. 

The Timbers got on the board first in the 18th minute when Diego Valeri converted a penalty kick. However, Seattle responded just two minutes later when Clint Dempsey scored off a cross from Nicolas Lodeiro. The Sounders took the lead in the 42nd minute when Chad Marshall headed in a Lodeiro corner kick. Dempsey added an insurance goal in the 89th minute to seal the victory. 

With this win, Seattle moves into second place in the Western Conference, four points behind FC Dallas. They will next host San Jose Earthquakes on July 29.

#  Atlanta United make it six wins in a row with emphatic victory over New York Red Bulls 

Atlanta United made sure that there would be no hangover from their first defeat of the season last time out as they put in an impressive performance to claim all three points against New York Red Bulls. The hosts were in fantastic form, scoring four goals without reply to make it six wins on the trot in all competitions.

It was a blistering start from Atlanta United, and they were rewarded for their attacking intent after just 10 minutes when Julian Gressel found the net with a fine finish. Things got even better for the home side moments later when Miguel Almiron doubled their lead with a superb solo effort.

The Red Bulls had no answer to the impressive Atlanta United side, and they went further behind before halftime when Josef Martinez found the net for his 18th goal of the season. There was still time for one more goal in the first period, and Gressel got his second of the game to make it 4-0 at the break.

The second half was a more subdued affair, but Atlanta United continued to create chances and Martinez almost got his second of the game but saw his effort come back off the post. However, it mattered little in the end as Tata Martino’s side ran out comfortable winners to move six points clear at the top of MLS standings.

#  Sporting Kansas City snatch late victory against San Jose Earthquakes to move into playoff spot 

Sporting Kansas City scored in the dying moments of their game against San Jose Earthquakes to snatch all three points and move into playoff spot.

It was a lacklustre game for much of the ninety minutes, but with both teams desperate for the win, things began to heat up in the last fifteen. San Jose looked the most likely to take all three points early on, but Kansas slowly grew into the game and started to create some chances of their own.

In the end it was Diego Rubio who scored what would be the winning goal, as he found himself in space at the back post to head home a cross from Graham Zusi.

The victory moves Sporting KC up to fifth place in the Western Conference, one point clear of LAFC who occupy the final playoff spot. They now face a crucial game against FC Dallas next week which could determine their playoff fate.

#  Chicago Fire stay hot with fourth consecutive win, this time over Columbus Crew 

The Chicago Fire continued their winning ways on Saturday night, taking down Columbus Crew SC 2-1 at Toyota Park. It was the fourth consecutive win for the Men in Red and they are now unbeaten in their last six games.

Nemanja Nikolic scored the first goal of the game in the 18th minute, heading a ball from Brandon Vincent past Zack Steffen in the Crew SC net. The goal was Nikolic’s sixth of the season, tying him with Diego Valeri for most in MLS.

The lead would only last until halftime, as Ola Kamara equalized for Crew SC just before the break. But in the 71st minute, Bastian Schweinsteiger put a ball into the box that found Luis Solignac, who headed it past Steffen for what would be the game-winning goal.

The victory keeps Chicago near the top of both the Eastern Conference and Supporters Shield standings, and they will next take on Toronto FC at BMO Field on Wednesday night.

#  Los Angeles Football Club extend unbeaten streak to six games

The Los Angeles Football Club extended their unbeaten streak to six games with a 0-0 draw against the Seattle Sounders on Sunday night.

This was the first time in franchise history that the club has gone undefeated in their first six games.

The draw also means that LAFC have not lost a game in MLS play this season, making them the only unbeaten team in the league.

"We're happy with the result," midfielder Benny Feilhaber said after the game. "Obviously, we would have liked to get three points, but road games in this league are tough."

Goalkeeper Tyler Miller was also impressed with the result. "I thought we played really well," Miller said. " Seattle is always a tough place to play and they have some good players. To come away with a point is definitely good."

With six points from their first two road games, LAFC now have seven points from their first five games overall, putting them atop of the Western Conference standings.

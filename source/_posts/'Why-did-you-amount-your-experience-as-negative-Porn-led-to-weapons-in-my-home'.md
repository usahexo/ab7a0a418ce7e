#  'Why did you amount your experience as negative? Porn led to weapons in my home'

The person asking this is Eugenia, a young woman who has been struggling with pornography addiction for the past 10 years. Her husband is also an addict.

"I grew up in a home without any rules or boundaries," Eugenia says. "My parents were never around, so I was always looking for ways to entertain myself. That's when I first saw porn. It felt exciting and new."

Eugenia started watching porn regularly and quickly became addicted. She began spending more and more time alone in her room watching videos. Soon, she was using pornography as a way to escape from her problems and to fill the emptiness she felt inside.

"Pornography made me feel validated," she says. "I was hooked on the feeling of being desired and wanted."

At the same time, Eugenia's home life was spiraling out of control. Her parents had separated and her older brother had started abusing drugs and alcohol. Eugenia felt lost and alone. The only thing that made her feel good was pornography.

"Pornography gave me a false sense of security," she says. "I thought it would make me happy, but it only caused more problems."

Eugenia's addiction soon began affecting her relationships with others. She became isolated and withdrawn, and her marriage began to fall apart. Her husband knew about her addiction but he was powerless to help her overcome it.

"Pornography led to weapons in my home," Eugenia says solemnly. "I was so desperate for excitement that I started using sex toys to get my fix. But those just weren't enough."

One day, Eugenia stumbled across some online articles about extreme pornography - videos of women being raped or tortured. She found herself watching these videos over and over again, even though they made her feel sick inside.

"I knew what I was doing was wrong," she says, "but I couldn't stop."

The final straw came when Eugenia's husband caught her watching violent porn videos on their computer. He was devastated and decided to leave her permanently. Eugenia hit rock bottom: she was unemployed, estranged from her family, and deeply addicted to pornography. She didn't know where to turn for help.


Thankfully, Eugenia eventually sought professional help from a therapist whospecialized in treating pornography addiction . With the support of this therapist, she slowly began to recover from her addiction . Today, she is cancer freeand has been sober for six years . Although her journey has been difficult,Eugeniatalks openly about her experiences in orderto help others who are struggling with similar issues .

#  'Why did you amount your experience as negative? Gambling left me penniless'

The experience of gambling can be extremely positive, providing a thrilling and exciting experience that can produce a feeling of exhilaration. However, for some people, gambling can also be a negative experience, leaving them penniless and feeling out of control.

Gambling can be an addiction for some people, as they may find it difficult to stop playing, no matter how much money they lose. Gambling can also lead to feelings of guilt and shame, as people may feel that they have let themselves and their families down.

Some people who gamble excessively may also experience financial difficulties as a result of their gambling. They may end up spending too much money on casino games or betting on sports, leading to significant financial losses. This can then have a knock-on effect on other areas of their life, such as their job or relationships.

If you are struggling with gambling-related issues, it is important to seek help. There are various organisations available that can offer support and advice, such as Gamblers Anonymous or the National Problem Gambling Clinic. Talking to someone who understands what you are going through can be really helpful in managing your gambling behaviour.

#  'Why did you amount your experience as negative? Violence ruined my life'

A life full of violence and hurt left me feeling like I had no other choice. It seemed like the only way out was suicide. I wanted to die because life felt so unbearable, dark, and scary. Experiencing and witnessing violence throughout my childhood and adult years resulted in trauma that numbed me emotionally. I shutdown and avoided any situation that could have potentially been unsafe or lead to more violence.

Growing up in a household where there was always yelling, verbal abuse, and physical violence made me scared of people. As a result, I became isolated and had very few friends. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone because ultimately they would either leave me or hurt me. Doing anything on my own was difficult because I lacked self-confidence and felt like I couldn't do anything right. It wasn't until much later in life that I realized how damaging my experience with violence had been.

What makes recovering from trauma so difficult is that it's not just one event that we need to heal from, but rather a series of events that have occurred over time. These events have left us feeling broken, alone, and unworthy of love or happiness. For a very long time, I carried the weight of my experiences around with me like a heavy backpack. It was exhausting and took up so much energy that I didn't have leftover for anything else.

In order to begin my healing journey, I first needed to acknowledge that the experiences I went through were indeed traumatic. This was a difficult task because it meant that I had to accept the reality of what happened to me – something that I had spent so many years trying to forget about. Once I acknowledged the trauma, then I could start working through it using different therapies such as counselling and meditation.

For a long time, violence shaped who I was as a person. It wasn't until much later on in life that I realized how much harm it had caused me. Despite this realization, though, it doesn't mean that the pain or trauma goes away overnight – it takes time, patience, and effort to start moving on from something so traumatic.

#  'Why did you amount your experience as negative? Pornography addiction caused me to lose my job' 

In the summer of 2014, I was fired from my job of three years because my employer found out I was addicted to pornography. Looking back, I can see that my addiction led me to act in ways that were inappropriate for the workplace and jeopardized my position.

When I was first hired, I was a diligent worker who always went the extra mile. My bosses praised me for my hard work and dedication. But as my addiction took hold of me, my work ethic began to decline. I started coming in late, taking unauthorized breaks, and browsing porn websites on my work computer. My performance slipped and eventually I was let go.

If you're struggling with a pornography addiction, know that you're not alone. Millions of people are affected by this problem every year. But there is hope. There are resources available to help you overcome your addiction and get your life back on track. Don't be ashamed to ask for help; admitting you have a problem is the first step on the road to recovery.

#  'Why did you amount your experience as negative? Pornography caused me to withdraw from social activities

Pornography is a big issue and it shouldn’t be taken lightly. I am someone who used to watch pornography and I can say that it really didn’t do anything positive for me. In fact, pornography made me feel really bad about myself and my body. It caused me to withdraw from social activities and made me feel really alone. I don’t think that pornography is healthy for anyone and I would encourage people to stay away from it.

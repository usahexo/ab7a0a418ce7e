#  Tips for betting sports: What does minus signify in point spread Žalgiris?

In Žalgiris basketball match, one of the bets you can place is on the point spread. You are basically betting that Žalgiris will beat BC Lietkabelis by more than the number of points indicated by the minus sign in the point spread. For example, if a point spread reads -5.5, this means that Žalgiris is favored to win by six or more points, and thus Lietkabelis would be an underdog. If you bet on Žalgiris and they only win by five points, then you would lose your bet even though they technically won the game.

Some people find it confusing that a minus sign would mean that Žalgiris is supposed to win by more than the number of points listed after the minus sign. In other words, why isn't a plus sign used instead? The answer has to do with how sports betting works. When you see a minus sign in front of a number in a point spread, this means that the favorite needs to win by more than that number for your bet to payout. A plus sign would indicate that the underdog can lose by up to that number of points and you would still win your bet.

So when looking at point spreads, always remember that anything listed after the minus sign is how many points Žalgiris is favored to win by. And anything listed after the plus sign is how many points Lietkabelis can lose by while still allowing you to collect on your bet.

The minus in point spread Žalgiris tells you how much money you need to bet in order to win $100. So, if the minus is -5.0, that means you would need to bet $500 to win $100. If the minus is -10.0, that means you would need to bet $1,000 to win $100.

#  How to make money betting on sports: understand minus in point spread Žalgiris!

In order to make money betting on sports, it is important to understand how the minus in point spread works. Žalgiris is a Lithuanian basketball team playing in the EuroLeague. In their match against CSKA Moscow on September 21, 2018, they were minus 9.5 points at halftime. This means that a bettor who bets on CSKA Moscow would win if CSKA Moscow wins by more than 9 points in the game. However, a bettor who bets on Žalgiris would only win if Žalgiris wins the game or loses by fewer than 9 points.

It is important to note that the minus in point spread does not always indicate which team is expected to win the game. Rather, it reflects the difference between the two teams’ point spreads. In this case, CSKA Moscow was favored by 9.5 points and Žalgiris was underdog by 9.5 points.

#  Always know the point spread when betting sports: pay attention to minus sign!

It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of sports betting, but it's important to remember to always pay attention to the point spread. This is the number that reflects how large of a favorite or underdog a team is, and it's crucial to understand when betting on sports.

The minus sign next to the point spread is key; this indicates how much money you need to bet in order to win $100. So if you see -10 beside the point spread, it means you'd need to bet $110 to win $100. In contrast, a positive number beside the point spread means that you would win less than $100 for every $100 you bet.

Remember these basics when placing your bets, and you'll be on your way to winning big!

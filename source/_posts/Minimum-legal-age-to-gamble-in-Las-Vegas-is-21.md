#  Minimum legal age to gamble in Las Vegas is 21

In the state of Nevada, the minimum legal age to gamble is 21. This is typical for casinos found in Las Vegas and other gaming destinations around the Silver State. There are a variety of exceptions, however, that allow those as young as 18 years old to place bets at some venues.

One such exception is at the race track. At most racetracks in Nevada, including those located in Las Vegas, the minimum legal age to gamble is 18. This applies to all forms of gambling at the track, from betting on horses to playing the slots.

There are a few other places in Nevada where the minimum legal age to gamble is 18. These include some Indian-owned casinos as well as a small number of poker rooms located away from the Strip in Las Vegas. For all other casinos in Nevada, the minimum legal age is 21.

This rule extends not only to gambling but also drinking alcohol. The legal drinking age in Nevada is 21, so those under 21 are not allowed to drink even if they are able to gamble legally. This often creates a difficult situation for young people who visit Las Vegas because it is not always easy to tell which establishments are allowing gambling and which ones are serving alcohol.

The reason for this discrepancy between different types of gaming venues comes down to history. When gambling was first legalized in Nevada, lawmakers wanted to make sure that only those considered adults were able to participate. That decision has been tweaked over time, but the basic minimum age remains 21 for all casinos except for at the race track.

#  Parents: Beware! Slot machines may be too addictive for your kids

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games. They are also one of the most addictive. Recent studies have shown that kids as young as eight years old are being drawn to slot machines. And, once they start playing, they can’t seem to stop.

Slot machines are designed to be addictive. They use bright colors and flashing lights to create a sense of excitement. They also produce a lot of sound effects, which can be very appealing to kids. The sounds make it seem like you’re winning even when you’re not.

The bottom line is that parents need to be very careful about letting their kids play slot machines. If your kids are already addicted, you need to get them help before it’s too late.

#  Can You Gamble at 18 in Las Vegas?

The short answer to this question is yes, you can gamble in Las Vegas at the age of 18. However, there are a few things that you should know before venturing out to the gambling capital of the world.

First, most casinos will require players to be at least 21 years old in order to gamble on their property. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but they are far and few between. If you are under 21, you can still visit casinos in Las Vegas, but you will not be able to gamble inside.

Second, even if you are of legal age to gamble, there are some games that you will not be able to play. The most common example of this is poker. In Nevada, poker is only legal for people who are over the age of 21. This means that if you are 18 or 19 years old, you will not be able to play poker at any casino in Las Vegas.

Finally, it is important to remember that gambling can be addictive. If you find yourself losing money more often than not, it might be time to take a break from the casino floor. Gambling should always be seen as a form of entertainment and not as a way to make money.

When you’re looking for a fun and exciting getaway, Las Vegas is often the top destination choice. With world-famous casinos and resorts, along with endless entertainment options, it’s no wonder people flock to Sin City every year.

Gambling isn’t just limited to casinos in Las Vegas either. There are also a number of state-run lotteries and race tracks where you can place bets. Just be sure to check the age requirements before playing.

So if you’re wondering whether or not gambling is legal in Las Vegas at age 19, the answer is yes – but there are some things you need to know first! Do your research before hitting the casino floor and have fun enjoying all that Sin City has to offer.

#  What's the Legal gambling age in Nevada?

The legal gambling age in Nevada is 21. This is because of the Nevada Constitution, which states that "the Legislature shall provide by law for a minimum age for the operation of gaming devices and for the possession of a gambling device."

There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, 18-year-olds can gamble in some cases if they're accompanied by someone who is at least 21 years old. There are also a few places in Nevada where the legal gambling age is 18. These include some Indian reservations and social clubs.

If you're under 21, it's illegal to gamble in Nevada. You could face fines or jail time if you're caught doing so.

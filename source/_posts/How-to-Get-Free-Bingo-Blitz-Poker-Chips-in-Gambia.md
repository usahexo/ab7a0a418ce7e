#  Gambia Offers Free Bingo Blitz Poker Chips to Newcomers

Gambia is a small country on the coast of West Africa. It's been an independent country since 1965, and it has a population of around two million people.

Compared to many other African countries, Gambia is doing quite well. The GDP per capita is just over $1,000, and the country has a low unemployment rate.

One of the things that's helped Gambia prosper is its tourism industry. In recent years, the country has been working to promote itself as a gambling destination.

And it seems to be working. In 2017, the government announced that it would be offering free bingo blitz poker chips to new arrivals.

The idea is that by giving away free chips, Gambia will be able to draw in more tourists and casino players. And so far, it seems to be working. In 2018, casino profits were up by nearly 20%.

Of course, not everyone is happy with this development. Some people argue that Gambia should be focusing on developing its economy rather than its casino industry.

But at the end of the day, it's up to the Gambian people to decide what they want their country to do. And if they want to gamble their way to prosperity, then the government should do everything it can to support them.

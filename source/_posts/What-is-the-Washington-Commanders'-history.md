#  What is the Washington Commanders' history?

The Washington Commanders are a professional American football team that is set to compete in the inaugural season of the Alliance of American Football (AAF). The team is based in Washington, D.C. and is scheduled to play its home games at Audi Field.

The Commanders are owned by businessman Bill Dwyer, who also owns the ArenaBowl-champion Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League. The team has yet to announce any coaching or player personnel staff, though it is expected that many members of the Soul's staff will follow Dwyer to Washington. 

On September 19, 2018, the AAF announced that the Washington Commanders would be one of the charter members of the new league. The name was among those fan-voted on from a list of five finalists. 

The Commanders will compete in the East Division alongside: 


#  Who are some of the key players on the Washington Commanders?

In the inaugural season for the XFL, there are eight teams in total. Each team has a mix of players who have played in the NFL and college players who have yet to make it to the professional level. The Washington Commanders are led by Head Coach Pep Hamilton, who most recently was the quarterbacks coach for the Indianapolis Colts.

Here is a list of some of the key players on the Washington Commanders:

QB Cardale Jones: A former Ohio State Buckeye, Cardale Jones was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. After being released by the Bills, Jones signed with the Chargers but never played in a game for them. He is currently listed as the back-up quarterback for the Commanders.

RB Jaâ€™Quan Gardner: Gardner was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New England Patriots in 2018 but was released prior to the start of the regular season. He has since been signed by multiple teams but has yet to play in an NFL game. He is currently listed as the starter for the Washington Commanders.

WR Kasen Williams: Williams was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft. After being released by Seattle, he signed with Cleveland but never played in a game for them. He is currently listed as a third-string wide receiver for Washington.

OLB Jarrad Davis: Davis was drafted by Detroit Lions in first round (21st overall) of 2016 NFL Draft. He started all 16 games his rookie year and led Detroit in tackles with 133 tackles (95 solo). He is currently listed as a linebacker for Washington Commanders.

#  How did the Washington Commanders end up in MLS?

The Washington Commanders were founded in 2018 as an expansion team in the MLS. The Commanders are owned by the same ownership group as the NFL's Washington Redskins.

The Commanders were one of two expansion teams awarded in 2018, with Los AngelesFC being the other. The Commanders will play their home games at Audi Field, which is also home to the Redskins.

The MLS is a Division I men's professional soccer league in the United States and Canada. The league has 24 teams, with Atlanta United FC, FC Cincinnati, Inter Miami CF, and Nashville SC joining the league for the 2019 season.

#  What are the goals of the Washington Commanders for the upcoming season?

The Washington Commanders have their sights set high for the upcoming season. With a talented roster and a new head coach, they are looking to make a run at the playoffs.

Offensively, the Commanders will be led by quarterback Cardale Jones. Jones is coming off a solid season with the Atlanta Legends, and he is looking to build on that success in Washington. He will be surrounded by a talented group of receivers, including Emmanuel Sanders and DeAndre Hopkins. The running game will also be strong, with Kerryon Johnson and Alvin Kamara leading the way.

Defensively, the Commanders are led by linebacker Lavonte David. David is one of the most underrated players in the league, and he will be a key player for Washington this season. The defensive line is also strong, with Nick Bosa and JJ Watt leading the way.

Overall, the Commanders have lofty goals for the upcoming season. They are looking to make a run at the playoffs and win the championship.

#  What kind of style do the Washington Commanders play?

The Washington Commanders style of play is a mix of west coast and power run. They will use their speed at the wide receiver position to try and get downfield quickly, but they also have a punishing ground game.

This was on full display in their season opener against the Arizona Hotshots. While they lost the game 24-21, they had 377 yards of total offense, with 234 of those coming on the ground. This type of offense will be tough for any team to defend against.

With players like quarterback KeithPrice, running back Christine Michael, and wide receivers Jamar Summers and KhaDarel Hodge, the Commanders have plenty of firepower. And with a defense that features linemen Corey Liuget and Darius Philon, as well as linebacker Jeremiah Attaochu, they should be able to keep opponents off balance.

# What do the Commanders need to do to improve?

While the Washington Commanders looked good in their season opener against the Arizona Hotshots, there are still some things they need to improve on. One area of concern is their pass defense. They allowed 263 yards through the air in that game, which is something they will need to address if they want to make a deep playoff run.

Another issue that could cause them trouble is their turnover ratio. They had two interceptions and two fumbles in their first game, which led to 10 points for the Hotshots. If they can limit turnovers, it will help them considerably.

Overall, the Washington Commanders are a talented team that can compete with anyone in the league. With a little bit of improvement in certain areas, they should be one of the top teams in the AAF this year.

#  Hollywood Casino to Start Taking Sports Bets in Early January

Hollywood Casino, in partnership with the Penn National Gaming, announced on Tuesday that they will start taking sports bets on Jan. 9. The casino said in a statement that they "plan to offer a comprehensive and competitive betting menu on major professional and collegiate sporting events."

This development comes as no surprise, as Pennsylvania has been gearing up for sports betting legalization for some time now. In October, the state's lawmakers voted to legalize sports betting, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn a federal ban on the practice.

"We are excited to launch our sports betting operation on Jan. 9 and offer players a wide array of options to bet on their favorite teams," said Tim Wilmott, CEO of Penn National Gaming. "We have been preparing for this day for many months and look forward to providing our customers with an outstanding experience."

The casino plans to offer betting on NFL games, college games (including March Madness), MLB games, NBA games, NASCAR races, and more. Bettors will be able to place traditional bets (such as predicting the winner of a game), as well as more creative wagers (such as predicting how many points a player will score).

It's not yet clear what the specific licensing procedures will be in Pennsylvania, but Hollywood Casino says that it expects "to be operational statewide by summer." In other states where sports betting has been legalized, such as New Jersey and Delaware, casinos have had to pay an upfront fee in order to offer sports betting services.

It remains to be seen how much revenue Pennsylvania's new sports betting industry will generate. However, given that there are already 12 million people within driving distance of a casino in the state, there is certainly potential for substantial growth.

#  Hollywood Casino to Officially Launch Sports Betting Operation on Monday

After months of anticipation and preparation, Hollywood Casino in Columbus will officially launch its sports betting operation on Monday.

At a press conference on Thursday, Ohio Lottery officials announced that the casino would offer both in-person and online wagering starting at 6 a.m. EST on Monday. Bettors will be able to place bets on professional and college sporting events, as well as other popular sporting activities such as golf and auto racing.

The casino has already set up a dozen kiosks where customers can make their bets, and officials say there is already “a high level of interest” in the new offering. In addition to the kiosks, interested players can also access the sportsbook through the Hollywood Casino app.

Gaming experts have predicted that sports betting could generate as much as $100 million in annual revenue for Ohio casinos. In order to capitalize on this potential windfall, Hollywood Casino has allocated over $1 million for marketing and advertising its new sportsbook.

While casinos in other states have been able to offer sports betting for years, Ohio was one of only a few states that had not yet legalized the activity. That changed in May when Governor Mike DeWine signed legislation authorizing sports gambling within the state’s borders.

The new law allows casinos like Hollywood to partner with approved fantasy sports providers such as DraftKings and FanDuel. It also imposes a 12 percent tax on casino revenue from sports betting, with 75 percent of that money going to public schools and 25 percent earmarked for problem gambling initiatives.

#  Hollywood Casino Gears Up for Sports Betting with Extensive Training for Staff

The Hollywood Casino in Charles Town, West Virginia is getting ready for the legalization of sports betting by undergoing extensive training for its staff. The casino has been dealing with small sports bets for years, but now that it will be legal to place larger bets, the casino wants its employees to be knowledgeable about all the ins and outs of the process.

“It’s a whole different animal when you start talking about sports betting,” said Joey Brienza, Vice President of Race and Sports at Hollywood Casino. “There are so many more options for customers, and we want to make sure that our team can provide expert advice and guidance on all the different wagers that are available.”

Brienza and his team have put together an intensive training program that covers everything from the basics of sports betting to more complicated concepts like parlays and futures bets. The goal is to make sure that everyone who works at Hollywood Casino is comfortable with the new system and can help customers make informed decisions about their bets.

"We're excited to offer this new service to our customers," said Brienza. "And we want to make sure that they have a positive experience every time they visit our casino."

#  Hollywood Casino Set to Take Sports Bets Beginning Tomorrow

After a long wait, Hollywood Casino in Pennsylvania is finally set to offer sports betting starting tomorrow. There are still some restrictions in place, notably that bets can only be placed on-site, but this is nonetheless a major development for the casino and for sports betting in the state.

Pennsylvania is one of only a handful of states where sports betting is legal, and the Hollywood Casino had been waiting for the green light from regulators before starting up its operations. That light has now come, and it looks like things are ready to get underway.

There had been some talk that Hollywood Casino might delay its launch due to the tight competition in the state’s newly-opened online gambling market, but it would appear that the casino is moving ahead with its original plan. This should be good news for fans of both sports and gambling, as it will give them a new place to gamble on their favorite teams.

For those who are not familiar with how sports betting works, here is a quick primer. In most cases, you will need to place a bet before the start of the game. This can be done at a casino or online, depending on your location. You then watch the game and see if your team wins or not. If they do win, you receive payout based on your initial bet amount and the odds that were set when you made your bet.

Sports betting can be a lot of fun, but it can also be lucrative if you know what you are doing. The Hollywood Casino should provide a great opportunity to get into this exciting market, and I expect that we will see plenty of action there over the coming weeks and months.

#  Hollywood Casino Now Accepting Sports Bets

After the United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited states from legalizing sports betting, Hollywood Casino in Pennsylvania has announced that it will now begin accepting bets on sports games.

The casino is located on the border of Harrisburg and Hershey, and is one of the first in Pennsylvania to offer sports betting. Customers can place bets at kiosks in the casino or through the Hollywood Casino app.

Pennsylvania is one of six states that have already legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court's ruling in May. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Rhode Island all now allow residents to bet on sports games.

Sports betting has been a big business in Las Vegas for many years, but was illegal in most states until the recent Supreme Court ruling. The American Gaming Association estimates that up to $150 billion is wagered on sports each year, most of it illegally.

Now that states are free to legalize sports betting, there is expected to be a major expansion of this industry. There are already plans for new casinos and racetracks to open up specifically for sports betting in several states, including Pennsylvania.

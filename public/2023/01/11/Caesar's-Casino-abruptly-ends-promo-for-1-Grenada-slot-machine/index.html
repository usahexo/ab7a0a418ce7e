<p>The slot machine, called “Grenada 100,” offered a return-to-player percentage of only 92%. That means the house – Caesar’s Casino in this case – would keep 8% of all money put into the game by players.</p>
<p>Some players said that they were told about the high house edge before playing, but others claimed they were not given fair warning.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Tuesday, Caesar’s Casino said: “It has come to our attention that a number of our customers are unhappy with the ‘Grenada 100’ slot machine. We would like to assure all of our customers that we take their satisfaction very seriously. Accordingly, we have made the decision to remove this game from our lineup.”</p>
<p>The casino did not say whether it would offer players any sort of compensation for their losses on the game.</p>
<h1 id="What-happened-to-the-Caesar’s-Casino-game-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine"><a href="#What-happened-to-the-Caesar’s-Casino-game-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine" class="headerlink" title="What happened to the Caesar’s Casino game promo for 1 Grenada slot machine?"></a>What happened to the Caesar’s Casino game promo for 1 Grenada slot machine?</h1><p>On Tuesday, November 21, 2017, the Grenada slot machine at Caesar’s Casino stopped working and players could not collect their winnings. The casino was offering a promotional $1,000 prize for players who hit the jackpot on the machine. When it became apparent that the machine was not working, many players contacted customer service to ask what they should do. Some people were even given different information by customer service representatives.</p>
<p>One player, who goes by the name of JJ, said that he was told by a customer service representative that he needed to provide his social security number in order to collect his winnings. He was also told that he needed to go to the cashier and ask for a form to fill out. JJ said that he felt like he was being scammed and decided not to pursue his winnings any further. </p>
<p>Other players reported similar experiences with customer service. One player said that he was told he needed to provide a picture ID even though he had hit the jackpot. Another player said she was told she couldn’t claim her prize because she had used a bonus code when she played the game. </p>
<p>Players took to social media to express their frustration with the situation. Many of them said that they felt like they had been scammed by the casino. Some called for a boycott of Caesar’s Casino until the issue was resolved. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, November 22, 2017, Caesar’s Casino released a statement on their Facebook page apologizing for the inconvenience and stating that they were working to resolve the problem. They also stated that they were giving away $2,000 in free SlotPlay as an apology to players affected by the issue. </p>
<p>It is unclear whether or not the machine will be fixed and players will be able to collect their winnings as promised.</p>
<h1 id="Caesar’s-Casino-offers-no-explanation-for-abrupt-end-to-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine"><a href="#Caesar’s-Casino-offers-no-explanation-for-abrupt-end-to-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine" class="headerlink" title="Caesar’s Casino offers no explanation for abrupt end to promo for 1 Grenada slot machine"></a>Caesar’s Casino offers no explanation for abrupt end to promo for 1 Grenada slot machine</h1><p>It’s unclear why Caesar’s Casino abruptly ended a promotional campaign for its only Grenada slot machine this week.</p>
<p>The machines, which are located in the casino’s international gaming area, were part of a three-weeklong promo that began on Nov. 10. But just days before it was set to end, the casino pulled all mention of the slot machines from its website and social media accounts.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, a Caesar’s spokesperson offered no explanation for the sudden change.</p>
<p>The lack of communication has left some players scratching their heads.</p>
<p>“I’m curious what happened,” said Sandra Toussaint, who had planned to visit the casino specifically to try out the Grenada slot machines. “I don’t understand why they would do something like that without any warning.”</p>
<p>Others remain hopeful that the machines will return at some point in the future.</p>
<p>“Hopefully they’ll bring them back,” said player Ken Pascual. “I had some fun playing them.”</p>
<h1 id="Did-something-happen-to-the-Caesar’s-Casino-game-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine"><a href="#Did-something-happen-to-the-Caesar’s-Casino-game-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine" class="headerlink" title="Did something happen to the Caesar’s Casino game promo for 1 Grenada slot machine?"></a>Did something happen to the Caesar’s Casino game promo for 1 Grenada slot machine?</h1><p>Slot machine games have been around since the 1800s, when Charles Fey invented the Liberty Bell machine.  Slot machines are usually placed in casinos and gaming establishments, where people can go to try their luck for some quick money. There is usually a variety of different games to choose from, with each game having its own set of rules and odds.</p>
<p>One of the more popular slot machine games is Caesar’s Casino, which is based on the popular Caesar’s Palace casino in Las Vegas. The game has players trying to win by matching symbols on three or more reels. There are also various bonus rounds available, which can add to player’s winnings.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been reports that the promo for 1 Grenada slot machine has been removed from Caesar’s Casino. This is quite puzzling, as Grenada is one of the more popular slot machines in the game. It is not clear why this decision was made, but it will likely be met with disappointment by many players.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on whether the promo will be reinstated in the future, but players can keep an eye on Caesar’s Casino’s website for updates. In the meantime, players can still enjoy other slot machine games at Caesar’s Casino.</p>
<h1 id="mystery-surrounds-sudden-end-to-Caesar’s-Casino-game-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine"><a href="#mystery-surrounds-sudden-end-to-Caesar’s-Casino-game-promo-for-1-Grenada-slot-machine" class="headerlink" title="mystery surrounds sudden end to Caesar’s Casino game promo for 1 Grenada slot machine"></a>mystery surrounds sudden end to Caesar’s Casino game promo for 1 Grenada slot machine</h1><p>In a puzzling turn of events, Caesar’s Casino abruptly ended its promotional game for the one-armed bandit machine “Grenada” without any warning or explanation. Just a few short days ago, players were logging in to try their luck at the Caribbean-themed slot game and collecting rewards like free spins and bonus points. But now the game has been pulled offline with no word on what happened or when it might return.</p>
<p>The sudden end to the promotion has left players frustrated and confused, with many taking to social media to vent their frustration. Some have even gone as far as to accuse Caesar’s Casino of rigging the game in order to benefit certain players. But so far there is no evidence to support this claim, and the casino has yet to give any indication of what may have caused thepromo to end prematurely.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is wait for Caesar’s Casino to provide an explanation for what happened. In the meantime, if you’re looking for some online slots action, we recommend trying out games from providers like Thunderkick and NetEnt.</p>

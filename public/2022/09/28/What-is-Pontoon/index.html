<h1 id="What-is-the-Pontoon-game"><a href="#What-is-the-Pontoon-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the Pontoon game?"></a>What is the Pontoon game?</h1><p>The Pontoon game is a casino table game that is very similar to blackjack. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the objective is to beat the dealer by achieving a total card value of 21 or less, without going over. The game can be played by up to six players, who are each dealt two cards face down. The dealer is also dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. </p>
<p>The player’s goal is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on the first two cards (called a “blackjack”), or by reaching a final card value closer to 21 than the dealer. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while all face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each. An Ace can be counted as either 1 point or 11 points, whichever results in a better hand for the player. </p>
<p>After all the players have received their cards, the dealer reveals his hidden card. If the dealer’s total card value is 16 or less, he must hit (take another card). If the dealer’s total card value is 17 or more, he must stand (stop taking cards). Depending on the dealer’s hand, he may hit or stand even if his total card value is 16 or less or 17 or more. </p>
<p>If either the player or dealer has a blackjack (total card value of 21), that player automatically wins and does not need to compare his hand against the dealer’s hand. If multiple players have blackjacks, then those players split the pot evenly. If no player has a blackjack, then the highest-value card in each hand (ace counting as 1 or 11) becomes the winner of the hand. In case of a tie (both player and dealer have same high-value card), it is considered a push and neither player nor dealer wins that particular round. </p>
<p>Pontoon originally comes from an eighteenth century British cheating game called “vingt-et-un” (“twenty-one”). It eventually made its way to America and became known as Black Jack. Pontoon was created in Australia during the early 1990s as an attempt to make Black Jack more interesting and challenging for players. </p>
<p>Pontoon has gradually grown in popularity over time and can now be found at many online and brick-and-mortar casinos around the world.</p>

<h1 id="Who-developed-the-Pontoon-game"><a href="#Who-developed-the-Pontoon-game" class="headerlink" title="Who developed the Pontoon game?"></a>Who developed the Pontoon game?</h1><p>Pontoon is a game that was developed in the early 1800s and is still popular today. The game was created by an unknown person, but it is thought to have originated in France. Pontoon quickly became popular in England and spread to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Pontoon is a variation of blackjack and is considered to be more challenging than traditional blackjack. The goal of the game is to accumulate cards that total as close as possible to 21, without exceeding this amount. Players can draw additional cards until they reach 21 or choose to “stick” with the cards they have. The player who has the highest total when all the cards are played wins the game.</p>
<p>Pontoon differs from blackjack in a few ways. In Pontoon, players are allowed to double down on any two cards and can also split pairs. There are also several bonus payouts available for certain hands, such as five card closest to 21.</p>
<p>Pontoon has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks in part to its inclusion in online casinos. Many people enjoy playing the game because it is both strategic and exciting. Whether you are a seasoned pro or just starting out, Pontoon is a great option for anyone looking for a challenging card game.</p>

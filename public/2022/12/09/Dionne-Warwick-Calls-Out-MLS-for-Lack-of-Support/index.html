        <h1 id="Dionne-Warwick-Calls-Out-MLS-for-Lack-of-Support"><a href="#Dionne-Warwick-Calls-Out-MLS-for-Lack-of-Support" class="headerlink" title="Dionne Warwick Calls Out MLS for Lack of Support"></a>Dionne Warwick Calls Out MLS for Lack of Support</h1><p>Dionne Warwick, the Grammy Award-winning American singer, has spoken out against Major League Soccer (MLS) for what she perceives as a lack of support from the league.</p>
<p>The 72-year-old Warwick, who is a member of both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, says that MLS has not done enough to promote her new song “Don’t Make Me Over”, which she recorded in conjunction with the league.</p>
<p>“I don’t think they (MLS) know how to market things very well,” Warwick said in an interview with Billboard. “They just put it out there and expect it to take off. There needs to be more of a passion for it on their part. They need to be more involved.”</p>
<p>Warwick also took issue with MLS’s decision to charge teams $150,000 annually for use of its copyrighted songs, noting that the NFL charges only $10,000 per team.</p>
<p>The league responded by issuing a statement saying that it has been working hard to promote Warwick’s song and that it is committed to working with her in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Dionne-Warwick-Quits-MLS-After-16-Years"><a href="#Dionne-Warwick-Quits-MLS-After-16-Years" class="headerlink" title="Dionne Warwick Quits MLS After 16 Years"></a>Dionne Warwick Quits MLS After 16 Years</h1><p>Dionne Warwick has announced her retirement from MLS after 16 years of service.</p>
<p>“It has been a great honor to represent MLS and its fans around the world for the past 16 years,” Warwick said in a statement. “I will always cherish my time with this league and its amazing players.”</p>
<p>A two-time MLS Cup champion, Warwick retires as the all-time leader in appearances (323) and minutes played (27,513). She is also second all-time in goals (55) and assists (77), trailing only Mia Hamm in both categories.</p>
<p>“Dionne was an integral part of our league during her time here and we are grateful for everything she has done for MLS,” said Commissioner Don Garber. “She has been an excellent ambassador for our sport and we wish her all the best in her retirement.”</p>
<h1 id="Dionne-Warwick-Blames-MLS-for-Unprofessionalism"><a href="#Dionne-Warwick-Blames-MLS-for-Unprofessionalism" class="headerlink" title="Dionne Warwick Blames MLS for Unprofessionalism"></a>Dionne Warwick Blames MLS for Unprofessionalism</h1><p>Dionne Warwick has cited MLS’s lack of professionalism as the main reason why she will no longer perform at their annual All-Star game.<br>“It’s not that I don’t support the sport,” Warwick said in a statement, “I just don’t feel that MLS is doing enough to ensure that its players and staff are up to professional standards.”</p>
<p>Warwick pointed to a number of recent incidents in which MLS players and staff have behaved in a manner that she felt was unbecoming of a professional athlete. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A player assaulting a member of the press</li>
<li>Several players being arrested for driving under the influence</li>
<li>An assistant coach caught using a racial slur</li>
</ul>
<p>“These kinds of things simply don’t happen in other professional sports leagues,” Warwick said. “And that’s why I’ve decided that I no longer want to be associated with MLS.”</p>
<h1 id="Dionne-Warwick-Ends-Relationship-with-MLS"><a href="#Dionne-Warwick-Ends-Relationship-with-MLS" class="headerlink" title="Dionne Warwick Ends Relationship with MLS"></a>Dionne Warwick Ends Relationship with MLS</h1><p>Dionne Warwick has announced that she is ending her relationship with Major League Soccer (MLS) after almost two years of dating.</p>
<p>In a statement released to the media, Warwick said that “despite our best efforts, we have come to the conclusion that this is not the right relationship for us.”</p>
<p>Warwick went on to say that she still believes in MLS and its potential, and will continue to support the league in any way she can.</p>
<p>Sources close to Warwick say that she was unhappy with the lack of progress MLS was making in terms of expanding and growing the league.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Did-Dionne-Warwick-Stop-Working-With-MLS"><a href="#Why-Did-Dionne-Warwick-Stop-Working-With-MLS" class="headerlink" title="Why Did Dionne Warwick Stop Working With MLS?"></a>Why Did Dionne Warwick Stop Working With MLS?</h1><p>For many years, Dionne Warwick was one of the most popular and successful singers in the United States. She had a string of hits in the 1960s and 1970s and she was known for her powerful voice and her stylish outfits. However, in the early 1980s, Warwick’s popularity began to decline. Her last major hit was in 1982 and her albums started to sell less and less.</p>
<p>Some people believe that Warwick’s decline in popularity is due to her decision to stop working with MLS, the music licensing company. In the early 1980s, MLS was going through some financial difficulties and it was unable to pay its artists as much as they had been paid in the past. As a result, Warwick decided to leave MLS and sign with another music licensing company.</p>
<p>However, other experts say that Warwick’s decline in popularity had nothing to do with her decision to leave MLS. They argue that her decline began in the late 1970s, long before she left MLS. In any case, it is clear that Warwick’s career never recovered from her decision to leave MLS. Her last album was released in 1988 and she has not released any new music since then.</p>

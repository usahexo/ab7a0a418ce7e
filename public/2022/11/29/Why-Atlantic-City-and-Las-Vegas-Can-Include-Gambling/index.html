There are good reasons for and against it. However, when it comes down to it, both cities can benefit from gambling.</p>
<p>One reason for including gambling in these cities is that it will attract tourists. Gambling is popular and people love to gamble.

<p>While there are good reasons for including gambling in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, there are also good reasons against it. For example, gambling can be addictive and can lead to negative consequences for people who engage in it.

<p>Atlantic City started with horse racing in 1854. In the early years, people would go to Atlantic City to gamble on horses. The first casino didn’t open until 1978, and it was a small bingo hall. Atlantic City really became a gambling destination when casinos were legalized in New Jersey in 1976. </p>
<p>Las Vegas had a much different story. Gambling was legalized in Nevada in 1931, but it wasn’t until the 1940s that Las Vegas became a popular gambling destination. The first casino in Las Vegas was the El Rancho, which opened in 1941. </p>
<p>So why did Atlantic City and Las Vegas become the gambling destinations they are today? There are several reasons.</p>
<p>First, both cities have been able to attract high-Rollers. This is because both cities have been able to offers lots of gaming options, including table games and slots. In addition, both cities have been able to offer luxury hotels and casinos resorts. These resorts offer entertainment options such as concerts and shows, which attracts high-Rollers and other tourists. </p>
<p>Second, both cities have been able to promote themselves as gambling destinations. For example, Atlantic City has a Boardwalk that stretches for more than 4 miles (6 kilometers). The Boardwalk is home to several casinos, restaurants, and shops. In addition, there are several landmarks in Atlantic City, such as the Absecon Lighthouse. </p>
<p>Las Vegas has also done a good job of promoting itself as a gambling destination. Some of the attractions in Las Vegas include the Strip (which is home to many famous casinos), the Fremont Street Experience (a pedestrian mall with a light show), and Lake Mead (which offers boating and fishing). </p>
<p>Finally, both cities have benefited from being located close to major metropolitan areas. Atlantic City is located about an hour away from Philadelphia, while Las Vegas is located about four hours away from Los Angeles. This makes it easy for people living in these metropolitan areas to visit these cities for a weekend of gambling fun!</p>
